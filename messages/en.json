          "question": "What level of customization does MarketFlex allow?",
          "answer": "MarketFlex is designed to be fully customizable. It's a boilerplate that provides a solid structure and functional components, but you will always need to code to adapt it to your specific needs. The advantage is that the code is well-organized, documented, and follows clear design patterns."
        },
        {
          "question": "What technology stack does MarketFlex use?",
          "answer": "MarketFlex is built with Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage), Shadcn/UI, TailwindCSS, and MercadoPago SDK. It includes support for i18n with next-intl and themes with next-themes. You can modify any part of the stack according to your needs."
        },
        {
          "question": "What technical skills do I need to use MarketFlex?",
          "answer": "You'll need experience with React/Next.js, TypeScript, and basic knowledge of PostgreSQL. Experience with Supabase is recommended but not essential, as the documentation includes detailed guides on its use in the project."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can I modify or extend the data models?",
          "answer": "The structure uses JSONB fields for flexibility, but you can also modify Supabase migrations or add new tables according to your needs. The documentation includes examples of how to extend the data model while maintaining compatibility with future updates."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I integrate payment processors other than MercadoPago?",
          "answer": "Yes, although it comes with MercadoPago integrated, the code uses an adapter pattern that allows you to implement other processors like Stripe or PayPal. The documentation includes guides for these alternative integrations."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I contribute to the project?",
